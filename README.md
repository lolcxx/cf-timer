A basic timer that appears on Codeforces problem pages, for a competitor to stay aware of time taken during contest or for a user working on time bound practice.

In case of a problem with a AC submission already, the timer will be paused by default, and you can volutarily start/pause/reset.
Otherwise, whenever you open a new problem without an AC submission, timer will be started by default.
